# Creating CentOS 6.5 (2.6.32-504) based on chef/centos-6.5 (2.6.32-431) (GuestAdditions 4.3.8) using VirtualBox 4.3.12

vagrant init chef/centos-6.5
vagrant up
# upgrading GuestAdditions from 4.3.8 to 4.3.12 and mounting /vagrant shared folder fail
```
Failed to mount folders in Linux guest. This is usually because
the "vboxsf" file system is not available. Please verify that
the guest additions are properly installed in the guest and
can work properly. The command attempted was:

mount -t vboxsf -o uid=`id -u vagrant`,gid=`getent group vagrant | cut -d: -f3` vagrant /vagrant
mount -t vboxsf -o uid=`id -u vagrant`,gid=`id -g vagrant` vagrant /vagrant

The error output from the last command was:

/sbin/mount.vboxsf: mounting failed with the error: No such device
